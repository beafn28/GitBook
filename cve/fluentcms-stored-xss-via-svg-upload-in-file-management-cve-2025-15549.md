# FluentCMS Stored XSS via SVG Upload in File Management  (CVE-2025-15549)

**Author:** Beatriz Fresno Naumova (beafn28), Jarosław Wawiórko

**Date:** 29/01/2026

**Vendor:** FluentCMS

**Product:** FluentCMS

**Versions affected:** ≤ 0.0.5

**Component:** File Management module (SVG upload handling)

**CWE:** CWE-79 – Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-Site Scripting)

**Attack type:** Remote (authenticated)

**Impact:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

FluentCMS versions up to and including **0.0.5** are affected by a **stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability in the **File Management module**.

The application allows authenticated administrators to upload **SVG files** without proper sanitization. Since SVG files can contain embedded JavaScript, a malicious administrator can upload a crafted SVG file containing arbitrary JavaScript code.

Because uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible directory and served without restrictive security headers, the malicious JavaScript is executed in the browser of **any user who accesses the uploaded file URL**, including unauthenticated visitors.

### Impact

#### Primary impact

Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browser context of users accessing the malicious SVG file.

#### Consequences

* Execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript
* User interface manipulation
* Redirection to malicious external websites
* Potential session compromise depending on browser context

### CVSS Details

#### CVSS v4.0 Vector

`CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N`

**Base Score:** 4.8 (Medium)

### Solution

At the time of disclosure, no official fix was available.

### Recommendation

* Disallow SVG uploads or strictly sanitize SVG content before storage.
* Remove or neutralize embedded JavaScript within uploaded files.
* Serve uploaded files with restrictive security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`).
* Restrict public access to uploaded files when possible.

### Mitigation

* Validate file types beyond extension checks.
* Sanitize SVG files using a secure SVG sanitizer.
* Serve user-uploaded files from a separate domain.
* Perform regular security reviews of file upload functionality.
