# Broken Access Control in LibreTime analytics endpoints (CVE-2025-60427)

**Author:** Beatriz Fresno Naumova (beafn28)

**Date:** 17/10/2025

**Vendor:** LibreTime

**Product:** LibreTime

**Versions affected:** 3.0.0-alpha.10 and possibly earlier

**Component:** Analytics module - Web UI and API endpoints handling analytics data

**CWE:** [CWE-284 - Improper Access Control](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

**Attack type:** Remote (requires authenticated DJ account)

**Impact:** Information Disclosure

### Description

LibreTime 3.0.0-alpha.10 (and possibly earlier) contains a broken access control issue in its analytics subsystem. An authenticated user assigned the DJ role can access analytics endpoints (via the web UI or direct API calls) that return station-wide metrics. The backend fails to enforce role-based permission checks on these analytics endpoints, allowing less-privileged users to retrieve sensitive station-level analytics that should be restricted to administrators or managers.

### Impact

* **Primary impact:** Information disclosure (station-wide analytics and metrics exposed to unauthorized users).
* **Consequences:** Privacy exposure, operational reconnaissance, and enabling of subsequent targeted attacks or abuse (e.g., identifying high-value times, listener counts, station identifiers).
* **Approximate severity:** Medium.
* **Estimated CVSS v3.1 (approximate):** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N - Estimated Base Score: \~4.9–5.8 (Medium). _Final scoring should be performed by the CNA/CISA/NVD._

### Attack Details

* An authenticated account with the DJ role can call analytics API endpoints (or use the Web UI analytics views) and obtain station-wide metrics because the server does not verify that the requesting role is authorized to access those resources.
* This requires only a valid DJ account (no admin privileges), and can be performed remotely against a vulnerable instance.
* Example targets (illustrative — replace with exact endpoints observed): /api/analytics/overview, /api/metrics/station/\*, or other analytics related endpoints under /api/.

### Proof of Concept (POC) - Soon

### Mitigation

* Enforce RBAC server-side: Add explicit role checks on analytics endpoints so only admin/manager roles can retrieve station-wide metrics.
* Least privilege for DJ role: Restrict DJ role capabilities to DJ-specific operations (playlists, uploads, limited stats only about their own shows if needed).
* Return appropriate status codes: Endpoints should return 403 Forbidden for unauthorized roles, not 200 with data.
* Automated tests: Add unit and integration tests asserting that DJ accounts cannot access admin/analytics endpoints (expect 403).
* Audit logging: Log attempts to access analytics endpoints (user, role, timestamp) for monitoring and forensics.
* Documentation: Clearly document role capabilities and endpoint permissions to reduce regressions.
